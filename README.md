# Generate random sequence trajectory between sequence A and B  

## Description

This script generates a random sequence trajectory between two sequences A and B. The trajectory is generated by randomly selecting positions in sequence A and mutating them to match sequence B, creating intermediate sequences along the evolutionary path. The final trajectory is saved to a FASTA file.

## Setup

No additional dependencies are required beyond Python's standard library.

## Configuration

Edit the `evol_config.py` file to customize:
- `SEQUENCE_A`: Starting sequence with identifier (e.g., `('A', 'ABFD')`)
- `SEQUENCE_B`: Target sequence with identifier (e.g., `('B', 'EFGH')`)
- `NUM_EVOLUTION_STEPS`: Number of evolutionary steps to generate (default: 10)

## Usage

Run the script with:

```bash
python generate_random_sequence.py
```

This will:
1. Generate a random evolutionary path from sequence A to sequence B
2. Create a FASTA file named `rand_evol_A_B.fasta` containing all sequences in the path
3. Print a confirmation message when complete

## Output

The output FASTA file will contain:
- The original sequence A
- Intermediate sequences labeled I0, I1, I2, etc.
- The final sequence B
